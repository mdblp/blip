## Dependencies

We use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/ 'webpack module bundler') to bundle the JavaScript, CSS, and JSON assets in this repository into a single JavaScript bundle from which blip can import the pieces (components, functions, etc.) needed.

Some of the other dependencies we leverage in this repository are, like webpack, commonly used by many others building apps today with React, and some are a bit more unusual:
